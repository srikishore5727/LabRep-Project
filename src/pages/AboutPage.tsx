              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                LabReps was created with a simple but powerful mission: to make medical lab reports accessible 
                and understandable for everyone. We believe that patients should be able to comprehend their own
                health data without needing a medical degree.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Through intuitive visualizations and meaningful animations, we transform complex numerical 
                data into visual stories that make sense at a glance. Our goal is to empower patients with
                knowledge about their own health, reducing anxiety and improving health literacy.

                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium">Confusion:</span> Lab reports are filled with numbers and medical jargon 
                  that most patients find difficult to interpret.

                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium">Time Constraints:</span> Healthcare providers often have limited
